title: Hello World!
---
Let's start some blogging. As always, be friend with [Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/). 

This is Markdown way of code highlighting (with defining what language it refers to):

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

And the same without any language defined:

```
print("Hello World!")
```

Different way (native for Jekyll) of code highlighting with line numbers:

{% highlight python linenos %}

print("Hello World!")

{% endhighlight %}

Finally, the output is:

![hello_world](https://images90.fotosik.pl/405/5d73a5e843952d5f.png)
