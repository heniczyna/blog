title: Hello World!
---
Let's start some blogging. As always, be friend with [Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/). 


```python
print("Hello World!")
```

Different way (native for Jekyll) of highlighting the code with line numbers:

{% highlight python linenos %}

print("Hello World!")

{% endhighlight %}

which looks like below as pure code:

```
{% highlight python linenos %}
print("Hello World!")
print("Hello Hello!")
{% endhighlight %}
```

Try to code inline `val a = 4` in Markdown.

Finally, the output is:

![hello_world](https://images90.fotosik.pl/405/5d73a5e843952d5f.png)
